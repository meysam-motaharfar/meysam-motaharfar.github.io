My research mostly focuses on very early universe theoretical cosmology including cosmological perturbation theory, inflationary cosmology and its alternatives such as bouncing cosmology, ekpyrotic cosmology, cyclic cosmology and etc. In the past I worked on warm inflation which is an alternative dynamical realization of conventional (cold) inflationary cosmology in which inflaton dissipates its self-interaction energy to other quantum fields during inflation. If such dissipation process occurs with speed greater than the Hubble expansion rate, there will be a sustainable thermal bath with temperature greater than de Sitter temperature during inflationary phase. That's why this phase is called warm inflation rather cold inflation. I am open to any research which is related to deciphering the origin of universe. So I am very recently interested in quantum cosmology and theories of initial condition for the universe namely no-boundary and tunneling wavefunction proposals.
