My research mostly focuses on very early universe theoretical cosmology including cosmological perturbation theory, inflationary cosmology and its alternatives such as bouncing cosmology, ekpyrotic cosmology, cyclic cosmology and etc. In the past I worked on warm inflation which is an alternative dynamical realization of conventional (cold) inflationary cosmology in which inflaton dissipates its self-interaction energy to quantum fields during inflation and if such dissipation process occurs with speed greater than the Hubble expansion rate, thermal bath will have temperature greater then de Sitter temperature and so the universe will go through warm inflationary phase rather cold inflationary phase. Recently, I am interested in quantum cosmology and theories of initial condition for the universe namely no-boundary and tunneling wavefunction proposals.
